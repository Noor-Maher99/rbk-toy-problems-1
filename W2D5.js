1.You wrote a function called guessMyNumber before... that simulated a guessing game: 
the idea is that the function picks a random number between 0 and 5, 
and you invoke the function with your guess -- if you and the function are thinking of the same number,
 you win! Otherwise, the function informs you that your guess was incorrect. 
 A version of this game might look like this (the randInt function is included for convenience):
